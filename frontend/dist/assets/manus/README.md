# UI Manus Release Assets

This folder collects the official UI Manus release screenshots and artifacts.
Replace the placeholder screenshot with the final exports (e.g., `ui-manus-dashboard.png`, `ui-manus-transfers.png`).
Keep this README and assets in sync with the release notes before tagging v3.0.
